A few AIs for Teeworlds.

How to use
==========

It's just a few hooks added in controls.cpp, so you have to use a modified client.
These sources are from their 0.5.1 release.

You need 'bam' to build teeworlds, and GNU make, to launch the Makefile.
'bam' is a build tool that's been created for teeworlds. You can download
and compile it here: http://teeworlds.com/trac/bam/

NOTE: The 'bam' produced executable is actually in bam-0.x.x/src/
Yeah, that seems incredibly dumb, but that's true =)

Then, type "make" to build Teeworlds and the AIs, or "make test" to do the same + launch the client.
the "./teeworlds_d" produced executable is a regular client, so just connect to your
favorite server (bots aren't welcome outside LAN servers, as far as I know, on Internet you'll be banned.)


Adding your AI
==============

Add a XXXXAI.ooc file in ooc-ai/, and add it an XXXXAI: class extends AI
Just take example on NddAI.ooc, or look at the methods in AI.ooc

Then in ooc-ai/ooc-ai.ooc, change the getAI() method to instanciate your
AI instead. (And don't forget to import it, you silly)

Final words
===========

Have fun! Don't be evil =) Bots-vs-bots fights are fun, don't be silly
and don't use them against (innocent) humans. If you do so, you only show
that you don't know how to play yourself ;)
